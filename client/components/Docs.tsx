      <p>
        This is a multi purposed REST API that lets you make GET and POST
        request to our API. We group our data with mood tags that groups a list
        films and their associated mood tags that real people were in when they
        decided to watch these films. When you input the name of the movie you
        watched and the mood you were in it is added to our API along with alot
        of other data about that film that we take care of üòâ What this means?
        We have quality data from real people and we are keeping it freely
        available to you!

        The API can take a get request with no API tag and then return all the

        films with that tag.
